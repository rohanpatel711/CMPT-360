We have now entered the world of critical thinking and formal proofs! The assignment asks you to solve the following four problems. 

All discussions about the "idea of how to solve this question" or "whether this solution is correct" prohibited. You can only ask clarification questions about the Exercise but must not discuss any idea regarding solving the problem.  No handwritten answers will be graded. You must type all your answer text descriptions in a text editor (this is because handwritten answers are difficult to read and check for plagiarism). You can only draw images by hand and add them to your answer. If you are unable to type for special reasons then discuss that with your instructor. You must click on the following chapter numbers to get the correct edition of those book chapters. 

Problems: 

Chapter 7 Exercise 7, Chapter 8 Exercise 3 and Exercise 25, Chapter 10 Exercise 3  

* "Describe and analyze an algorithm" means you must provide pseudocode, a proof of correctness and complexity analysis. Please see Chapter 0 for more clarification.

* Marking scheme: You may assume the subject material refers to algorithms: general guidelines for the grading system for undergraduate students.
